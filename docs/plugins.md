# Plugins

You can easily extend QueryCat functionality by installing plugins. Plugins allow to add more functions for data processing. There are commands you can use for plugins management:

- `plugin list`. List all local and installed plugins.
- `plugin install <name>`. Install the plugin.
- `plugin remove <name>`. Remove the plugin.
- `plugin update <name>`. Update the plugin. If you provide `*` as name all plugins will be updated.

Make sure you keep you plugins versions up to date.

Here is the list of available plugins.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `QueryCat.Plugins.Logs` | Various functions to parse log files (IISW3C). |
